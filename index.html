Through the registration process, you will provide us with your e-mail address. We use Google Firebase for authentication and storing in-app progress. It provides us with a safe, secure authentication system to manage your sign-up and logging in to the app using an email address and a password.
It collects the following information from you:

•	Email address
•	User agents

Firebase Authentication uses the data to enable end-user authentication, and facilitate end-user account management. It also uses user-agent strings (a basic description of your device model) and IP addresses to provide added security and prevent abuse during sign-up and authentication.
The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you and to display personalized ads. The user can disable ads by making in-app purchases.
